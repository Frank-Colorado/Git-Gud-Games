# Git Gud Games

## Description

This website was created as a solo project in order to further practice using Typescript, React, RTK, and GraphQL. The website uses RAWG's game library API to allow users to search for games via name or genre. Each game has a page that displays the game's information, screenshots, trailers, and the best deals for the game which are pulled from the CheapShark API. Users can also create an account and add games to their favorites list.

## Credits

The concept for this website was built from a previous web app that I created. I wanted to rebuild it using Typescript, React, RTK, and GraphQL in order to practice using those technologies while also improving the overall design of the website and adding new features.
Here is a link to my repository for that web app: https://github.com/Frank-Colorado/get-good-games.git
